Psuedo for Psychic game
Need to have a function for a random letter to be chosen for each game
upon keydown for user input, we need to compare wheteher that is what the random letter chosen was
if it is, then we want to mark that as a win- add count to "var numberOfWins"
If it is not, then we want to add in the "wrongGuesses var" and count down from "guessesLeft var"
Upon game finishing, we need to fall our original random letter funtion 
-Also need to clear Guesses left/
